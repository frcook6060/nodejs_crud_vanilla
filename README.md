##Node.js Crud Vanilla

This is a really simple application that tests node.js. Its a basic
data driven crud application. This application doesn't do anything 
fancy just lets the user add a post using new post. Once the post is
is in the database which I'm using sqlite3 for that purpose, the user
should be able to edit and delete the small little post.

Its not a really big application but to demonstrate how to make a small
web application with node.js. 

The other thing this crud app demonstrates is how to create a web applicatoin
without a framework such as express.js. I'll be adding an example of using
express.js later.
